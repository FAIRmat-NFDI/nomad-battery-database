# Welcome to the `nomad-battery-database` documentation

A NOMAD plugin for parsing and visualizing curated/extracted experimental battery properties from the literature.

## Introduction

This battery database plugin allows you to parse structured YAML or CSV files containing battery material properties and visualize them through a dedicated application within NOMAD. It automatically extracts key performance indicators like capacity, voltage, and energy density, links them to their source publications, and provides interactive plots and filters for easy data exploration. This is crucial for building a comprehensive and searchable database of battery materials to accelerate research and development.
