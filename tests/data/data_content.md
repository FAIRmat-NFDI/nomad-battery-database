Capacity:
Refers to the amount of charge a battery material can store, typically measured in milliampere-hours per gram (mAh/g). This indicates the energy storage capability of the material.
Conductivity:
Represents the ability of a battery material to conduct electric current, measured typically in Siemens per centimeter (S/cm). This property is important for battery efficiency, especially relevant for electrolytes and electrode materials.
Coulombic Efficiency:
A measure of the charge efficiency of a battery material, expressed as a percentage (%). It is the ratio between the amount of charge extracted from the battery during discharge compared to the amount of charge put into the battery during charging.
Energy:
Describes the specific energy or energy density of a battery material, usually reported in watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). It quantifies the energy storage density and is critical for assessing battery performance.
Voltage:
Refers to the electrical potential difference of the battery material, measured in volts (V). Voltage determines how much electrical potential energy is available from the material.
Extracted\_name:
The chemically normalized compound name extracted from the literature, presented as structured chemical names detailing elemental composition.
Raw\_value:
The original numeric values extracted directly from the texts of the papers without normalization.
Raw\_unit:
Original units of measurement as extracted directly from the literature before standardization.
Value:
Numeric values that have been normalized and standardized from the raw extracted data to ensure consistency across the dataset.
Unit:
Normalized and standardized measurement units corresponding to each property after processing through ChemDataExtractor.
Tag:
Indicates whether data was directly extracted ("CDE") from the literature using ChemDataExtractor or was calculated using other properties' values.
Info:
Contains additional information extracted with the property values, typically current and cycle number, particularly relevant for the capacity property.
Type:
Classifies the material type, such as anode, cathode, electrolyte, or other battery component.
Specifier:
Specific textual expressions used to clearly identify each property type from the literature.
DOI:
Digital Object Identifier, providing a direct link to the original paper from which the data were extracted.
Journal:
The name of the academic journal in which the source paper was published.
Date:
The publication date of the source paper.
Title:
The title of the source paper.
Correctness:
Indicates whether the extracted data was manually validated as correct or incorrect, useful for assessing dataset reliability.
Warning:
Flags potential issues with the data, categorized as:
S (Series): indicates the data are part of a series within a single study.
R (Relevance): marks data that might not be directly relevant to battery materials.
L (Limit): identifies property values near the predefined extreme limits, suggesting they may have increased risk of error.
These terminologies and their detailed definitions are directly derived from the provided paper that describes the automated database creation using ChemDataExtractor software
